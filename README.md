# code-samples
This repository is used for code samples that I develop for educational purposes. There are some things, like the stuff under
the hacker x project, which were done quick and dirty in the form that hacker x expects.
Other parts of the project would give one a clearer view of my coding style, etc. These are problems that I have enjoyed solving in the 
areas of data structures, general java, and a rest service that runs in Spring Boot.
